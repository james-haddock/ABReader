The book was produced using Adobe InDesign CS (an unbelievably cool design tool that we can’t get enough of) and Adobe Photoshop CS. The book was typeset using Uncle Stinky, Mister Frisky (you think we’re kidding), Ann Satellite, Baskerville, Comic Sans, Myriad Pro, Skippy Sharp, Savoye LET, Jokerman LET, Courier New and Woodrow typefaces.</p><p>Interior design and production all happened exclusively on Apple Macintoshes — at Head First we’re all about “Think Different” (even if it isn’t grammatical). All Java code was created using James Gosling’s favorite IDE, <span class="emphasis"><em>vi</em></span>, Erich Gamma’s Eclipse.</p><p>Long days of writing were powered by the caffeine fuel of Honest Tea and Tejava, the clean Santa Fe air, and the grooving sounds of Banco de Gaia, Cocteau Twins, Buddha Bar I-VI, Delerium, Enigma, Mike Oldfield, Olive, Orb, Orbital, LTJ Bukem, Massive Attack, Steve Roach, Sasha and Digweed, Thievery Corporation, Zero 7 and Neil Finn (in all his incarnations) along with a heck of a lot of acid trance and more 80s music than you’d care to know about.</p></div></body></html>
