And you probably don’t want to spend a lot of time. And you want to <span class="emphasis"><em>remember</em></span> what you read, and be able to apply it. And for that, you’ve got to <span class="emphasis"><em>understand</em></span> it. To get the most from this book, or <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> book or learning experience, take responsibility for your brain. Your brain on <span class="emphasis"><em>this</em></span> content.</p><p>The trick is to get your brain to see the new material you’re learning as Really Important. Crucial to your well-being. As important as a tiger. Otherwise, you’re in for a constant battle, with your brain doing its best to keep the new content from sticking.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00013a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00013"></a><img src="../Images/image00499.jpeg" alt="image with no caption" hisrc="figs/web/xxixfig01.png.jpg"/></div></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>So how DO you get your brain to think Design Patterns are as important as a tiger?</strong></span></p><p>There’s the slow, tedious way, or the faster, more effective way. The slow way is about sheer repetition. You obviously know that you <span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> able to learn and remember even the dullest of topics, if you keep pounding on the same thing. With enough repetition, your brain says, “This doesn’t <span class="emphasis"><em>feel</em></span> important to him, but he keeps looking at the same thing <span class="emphasis"><em>over</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>over</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>over</em></span>, so I suppose it must be.”</p><p>The faster way is to do <span class="bolditalic">anything that increases brain activity</span>, especially different <span class="emphasis"><em>types</em></span> of brain activity. The things on the previous page are a big part of the solution, and they’re all things that have been proven to help your brain work in your favor. For example, studies show that putting words <span class="emphasis"><em>within</em></span> the pictures they describe (as opposed to somewhere else in the page, like a caption or in the body text) causes your brain to try to makes sense of how the words and picture relate, and this causes more neurons to fire. More neurons firing = more chances for your brain to <span class="emphasis"><em>get</em></span> that this is something worth paying attention to, and possibly recording.</p><p>A conversational style helps because people tend to pay more attention when they perceive that they’re in a conversation, since they’re expected to follow along and hold up their end. The amazing thing is, your brain doesn’t necessarily <span class="emphasis"><em>care</em></span> that the “conversation” is between you and a book! On the other hand, if the writing style is formal and dry, your brain perceives it the same way you experience being lectured to while sitting in a roomful of passive attendees. No need to stay awake.</p><p>But pictures and conversational style are just the beginning.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="hereapostrophes_what_we_did">Here’s what WE did</h2></div></div></div><p>We used <span class="bolditalic">pictures</span>, because your brain is tuned for visuals, not text. As far as your brain’s concerned, a picture really is worth 1,024 words. And when text and pictures work together, we embedded the text in the pictures because your brain works more effectively when the text is within the thing the text refers to, as opposed to in a caption or buried in the text somewhere.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00014a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00014"></a><img src="../Images/image00500.jpeg" alt="image with no caption" hisrc="figs/web/xxxfig01.png.jpg"/></div></div><p>We used <span class="bolditalic">redundancy</span>, saying the same thing in <span class="emphasis"><em>different</em></span> ways and with different media types, and <span class="emphasis"><em>multiple senses</em></span>, to increase the chance that the content gets coded into more than one area of your brain.</p><p>We used concepts and pictures in <span class="bolditalic">unexpected</span> ways because your brain is tuned for novelty, and we used pictures and ideas with at least <span class="emphasis"><em>some</em></span> <span class="bolditalic">emotional</span> <span class="emphasis"><em>content</em></span>, because your brain is tuned to pay attention to the biochemistry of emotions.

The more you understand, the less you have to memorize.</strong></span><br/>Don’t just <span class="emphasis"><em>read</em></span>. Stop and think. When the book asks you a question, don’t just skip to the answer. Imagine that someone really is asking the question. The more deeply you force your brain to think, the better chance you have of learning and remembering.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none"><span class="strong"><strong>② Do the exercises. Write your own notes.</strong></span><br/>We put them in, but if we did them for you, that would be like having someone else do your workouts for you. And don’t just <span class="emphasis"><em>look</em></span> at the exercises. <span class="strong"><strong>Use a pencil</strong></span>. There’s plenty of evidence that physical activity <span class="emphasis"><em>while</em></span> learning can increase the learning.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none"><span class="strong"><strong>③ Read the “There Are No Dumb Questions”</strong></span><br/>That means all of them.

Or at least the last <span class="emphasis"><em>challenging</em></span> thing.</strong></span><br/>Part of the learning (especially the transfer to long-term memory) happens <span class="emphasis"><em>after</em></span> you put the book down. Your brain needs time on its own, to do more processing. If you put in something new during that processing-time, some of what you just learned will be lost.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none"><span class="strong"><strong>⑤ Drink water. Lots of it.</strong></span><br/>Your brain works best in a nice bath of fluid. Dehydration (which can happen before you ever feel thirsty) decreases cognitive function.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none"><span class="strong"><strong>⑥ Talk about it. Out loud.</strong></span><br/>Speaking activates a different part of the brain. If you’re trying to understand something, or increase your chance of remembering it later, say it out loud. Better still, try to explain it out loud to someone else. You’ll learn more quickly, and you might uncover ideas you hadn’t known were there when you were reading about it.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none"><span class="strong"><strong>⑦ Listen to your brain.</strong></span><br/>Pay attention to whether your brain is getting overloaded.

If you’ve never seen UML before, don’t worry, we’ll give you a few pointers along the way. So in other words, you won’t have to worry about Design Patterns and UML at the same time. Our diagrams are “UML-<span class="emphasis"><em>like</em></span>” — while we try to be true to UML there are times we bend the rules a bit, usually for our own selfish artistic reasons.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>We don’t cover every single Design Pattern ever created.</strong></span></p><p>There are a <span class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of Design Patterns. The original foundational patterns (known as the GoF patterns), enterprise Java patterns, JSP patterns, architectural patterns, game design patterns and a lot more. But our goal was to make sure the book weighed less than the person reading it, so we don’t cover them all here. Our focus is on the core patterns that <span class="emphasis"><em>matter</em></span> from the original GoF patterns, and making sure that you really, truly, deeply understand how and when to use them. You will find a brief look at some of the other patterns (the ones you’re far less likely to use) in the appendix. In any case, once you’re done with <span class="emphasis"><em>Head First Design Patterns</em></span>, you’ll be able to pick up any pattern catalog and get up to speed quickly.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>The activities are NOT optional.</strong></span></p><p>The exercises and activities are not add-ons; they’re part of the core content of the book. Some of them are to help with memory, some for understanding, and some to help you apply what you’ve learned. <span class="bolditalic">Don’t skip the exercises</span>. The crossword puzzles are the only things you don’t <span class="emphasis"><em>have</em></span> to do, but they’re good for giving your brain a chance to think about the words from a different context.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>We use the word “composition” in the general OO sense, which is more flexible than the strict UML use of “composition.”</strong></span></p><p>When we say “one object is composed with another object” we mean that they are related by a HAS-A relationship. Our use reflects the traditional use of the term and is the one used in the GoF text (you’ll learn what that is later). More recently, UML has refined this term into several types of composition. If you are an UML expert, you’ll still be able to read the book and you should be able to easily map the use of composition to more refined terms as you read.</p><p><a id="iddle2528" class="indexterm"></a><span class="strong"><strong>The redundancy is intentional and important.</strong></span></p><p>One distinct difference in a Head First book is that we want you to <span class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> get it. And we want you to finish the book remembering what you’ve learned. Most reference books don’t have retention and recall as a goal, but this book is about <span class="emphasis"><em>learning</em></span>, so you’ll see some of the same concepts come up more than once.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>The code examples are as lean as possible.</strong></span></p><p>Our readers tell us that it’s frustrating to wade through 200 lines of code looking for the two lines they need to understand. Most examples in this book are shown within the smallest possible context, so that the part you’re trying to learn is clear and simple. Don’t expect all of the code to be robust, or even complete — the examples are written specifically for learning, and aren’t always fully-functional.</p><p>In some cases, we haven’t included all of the import statements needed, but we assume that if you’re a Java programmer, you know that <code class="literal">ArrayList</code> is in java.util, for example. If the imports were not part of the normal core JSE API, we mention it. We’ve also placed all the source code on the Web so you can download it. You’ll find it at <code class="literal">http://wickedlysmart.com/head-first-design-patterns/</code></p><p>Also, for the sake of focusing on the learning side of the code, we did not put our classes into packages (in other words, they’re all in the Java default package). We don’t recommend this in the real world, and when you download the code examples from this book, you’ll find that all classes <span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> in packages.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>The Brain Power exercises don’t have answers.</strong></span></p><p>For some of them, there is no right answer, and for others, part of the learning experience of the Brain Power activities is for you to decide if and when your answers are right. In some of the Brain Power exercises you will find hints to point you in the right direction.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="tech_reviewers">Tech Reviewers</h2></div></div></div><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00021a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00021"></a><img src="../Images/image00507.jpeg" alt="image with no caption" hisrc="figs/web/xxxivfig01.png.jpg"/></div></div><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00022a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00022"></a><img src="../Images/image00508.jpeg" alt="image with no caption" hisrc="figs/web/xxxvfig01.png.jpg"/><div class="caption"><p>Philippe Maquet</p></div></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><div><span class="emphasis"><em>In memory of Philippe Maquet</em></span></div><div>1960 - 2004</div><div>Your amazing technical expertise, relentless enthusiasm, and deep concern for the learner will inspire us always.</div><div><span class="emphasis"><em>We will never forget you.</em></span></div></blockquote></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h2></div></div></div><p><span class="bolditalic">At O’Reilly:</span></p><p>Our biggest thanks to <span class="strong"><strong>Mike Loukides</strong></span> at O’Reilly, for starting it all and helping to shape the Head First concept into a series. And a big thanks to the driving force behind Head First, <span class="strong"><strong>Tim O’Reilly</strong></span>. Thanks to the clever Head First “series mom” <span class="strong"><strong>Kyle Hart</strong></span>, “In Design King” <span class="strong"><strong>Ron Bilodeau</strong></span>, rock-and-roll star <span class="strong"><strong>Ellie Volkhausen</strong></span> for her inspired cover design, <span class="strong"><strong>Melanie Yarbrough</strong></span> for shepherding production, <span class="strong"><strong>Colleen Gorman</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Rachel Monaghan</strong></span> for their hardcore copyedits, and <span class="strong"><strong>Bob Pfahler</strong></span> for a much improved index. Finally, thanks to <span class="strong"><strong>Mike Hendrickson</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Meghan Blanchette</strong></span> for championing this book and building the team.</p><p><span class="bolditalic">Our intrepid reviewers:</span></p><p>We are extremely grateful for our technical review director <span class="strong"><strong>Johannes deJong</strong></span>. You are our hero, Johannes. And we deeply appreciate the contributions of the co-manager of the <span class="strong"><strong>Javaranch</strong></span> review team, the late <span class="strong"><strong>Philippe Maquet</strong></span>. You have single-handedly brightened the lives of thousands of developers, and the impact you’ve had on their (and our) lives is forever. <span class="strong"><strong>Jef Cumps</strong></span> is scarily good at finding problems in our draft chapters, and once again made a huge difference for the book. Thanks Jef! <span class="strong"><strong>Valentin Cretazz</strong></span> (AOP guy), who has been with us from the very first Head First book, proved (as always) just how much we really need his technical expertise and insight. You rock Valentin (but lose the tie).</p><p>Two newcomers to the HF review team, <span class="strong"><strong>Barney Marispini</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Ike Van Atta</strong></span> did a kick butt job on the book — you guys gave us some <span class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> crucial feedback. Thanks for joining the team.</p><p>We also got some excellent technical help from Javaranch moderators/gurus <span class="strong"><strong>Mark Spritzler</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Jason Menard</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Dirk Schreckmann</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Thomas Paul</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Margarita Isaeva</strong></span>. And as always, thanks especially to the javaranch.com Trail Boss, <span class="strong"><strong>Paul Wheaton</strong></span>.</p><p>Thanks to the finalists of the Javaranch “Pick the <span class="emphasis"><em>Head First Design Patterns</em></span> Cover” contest. The winner, Si Brewster, submitted the winning essay that persuaded us to pick the woman you see on our cover. Other finalists include Andrew Esse, Gian Franco Casula, Helen Crosbie, Pho Tek, Helen Thomas, Sateesh Kommineni, and Jeff Fisher.</p><p>For the 2014 update to the book, we are so grateful to the following technical reviewers: George Hoffer, Ted Hill, Todd Bartoszkiewicz, Sylvain Tenier, Scott Davidson, Kevin Ryan, Rich Ward, Mark Francis Jaeger, Mark Masse, Glenn Ray, Bayard Fetler, Paul Higgins, Matt Carpenter, Julia Williams, Matt McCullough, and Mary Ann Belarmino.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="even_more_peoplethe_large_number_of_ackn">Even more people<sup>[<a id="pref06fn01" epub:type="noteref" class="footnote" href="part0007.xhtml#ftn.pref06fn01">1</a>]</sup></h2></div></div></div><p><span class="bolditalic">From Eric and Elisabeth</span></p><p>Writing a Head First book is a wild ride with two amazing tour guides: <span class="strong"><strong>Kathy Sierra</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Bert Bates</strong></span>. With Kathy and Bert you throw out all book writing convention and enter a world full of storytelling, learning theory, cognitive science, and pop culture, where the reader always rules. Thanks to both of you for letting us enter your amazing world; we hope we’ve done Head First justice. Seriously, this has been amazing. Thanks for all your careful guidance, for pushing us to go forward, and most of all, for trusting us (with your baby). You’re both certainly “wickedly smart” and you’re also the hippest 29-year-olds we know. So... what’s next?</p><p>A big thank you to <span class="strong"><strong>Mike Loukides, Mike Hendrickson</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Meghan Blanchette</strong></span>. Mike L. was with us every step of the way. Mike, your insightful feedback helped shape the book and your encouragement kept us moving ahead. Mike H., thanks for your persistence over five years in trying to get us to write a patterns book; we finally did it and we’re glad we waited for Head First. And Meg, thanks for diving into the update with us; we couldn’t have done it without you.</p><p>A very special thanks to <span class="strong"><strong>Erich Gamma</strong></span>, who went far beyond the call of duty in reviewing this book (he even took a draft with him on vacation). Erich, your interest in this book inspired us and your thorough technical review improved it immeasurably. Thanks as well to the entire <span class="strong"><strong>Gang of Four</strong></span> for their support &amp; interest, and for making a special appearance in Objectville. We are also indebted to <span class="strong"><strong>Ward Cunningham</strong></span> and the patterns community who created the Portland Pattern Repository — an indespensible resource for us in writing this book.</p><p>It takes a village to write a technical book: <span class="strong"><strong>Bill Pugh</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Ken Arnold</strong></span> gave us expert advice on Singleton. <span class="strong"><strong>Joshua Marinacci</strong></span> provided rockin’ Swing tips and advice. <span class="strong"><strong>John Brewer’s</strong></span> “Why a Duck?” paper inspired SimUDuck (and we’re glad he likes ducks too). <span class="strong"><strong>Dan Friedman</strong></span> inspired the Little Singleton example. <span class="strong"><strong>Daniel Steinberg</strong></span> acted as our “technical liason” and our emotional support network. Thanks to Apple’s <span class="strong"><strong>James Dempsey</strong></span> for allowing us to use his MVC song. And thank you to <span class="strong"><strong>Richard Warburton</strong></span> who made sure our Java 8 code updates were up to snuff for this updated edition of the book.</p><p>Last, a personal thank you to the <span class="strong"><strong>Javaranch review team</strong></span> for their top-notch reviews and warm support. There’s more of you in this book than you know.</p><p><span class="bolditalic">From Kathy and Bert</span></p><p>We’d like to thank Mike Hendrickson for finding Eric and Elisabeth... but we can’t. Because of these two, we discovered (to our horror) that we aren’t the <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> ones who can do a Head First book. ; ) However, if readers want to <span class="emphasis"><em>believe</em></span> that it’s really Kathy and Bert who did the cool things in the book, well, who are <span class="emphasis"><em>we</em></span> to set them straight?</p></div><div class="footnotes" epub:type="footnotes"><br/><hr style="width: 100; align: left;" data-AmznRemoved-M8="true"/><div class="footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="ftn.pref06fn01"><p><sup>[<a class="para" href="part0007.xhtml#pref06fn01">1</a>] </sup>The large number of acknowledgments is because we’re testing the theory that everyone mentioned in a book acknowledgment will buy at least one copy, probably more, what with relatives and everything.
