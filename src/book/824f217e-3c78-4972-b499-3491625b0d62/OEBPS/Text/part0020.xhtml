Here’s a little mnemonic you can repeat to yourself to remember it:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><div>“If you find yourself in a context with a problem that has a goal that is affected by a set of constraints, then you can apply a design that resolves the goal and constraints and leads to a solution.”</div></blockquote></div><p>Now, this seems like a lot of work just to figure out what a Design Pattern is. After all, you already know that a Design Pattern gives you a solution to a common recurring design problem. What is all this formality getting you? Well, you’re going to see that by having a formal way of describing patterns we can create a catalog of patterns, which has all kinds of benefits.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00775a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00775"></a><img src="../Images/image01277.jpeg" alt="image with no caption" hisrc="figs/web/586fig01.png.jpg"/></div></div><p>You might be right; let’s think about this a bit... We need a <span class="emphasis"><em>problem</em></span>, a <span class="emphasis"><em>solution</em></span> and a <span class="emphasis"><em>context</em></span>:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none"><span class="strong"><strong>Problem</strong></span>: How do I get to work on time?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none"><span class="strong"><strong>Context</strong></span>: I’ve locked my keys in the car.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none"><span class="strong"><strong>Solution</strong></span>: Break the window, get in the car, start the engine and drive to work.</li></ul></div><p>We have all the components of the definition: we have a problem, which includes the goal of getting to work, and the constraints of time, distance and probably some other factors. We also have a context in which the keys to the car are inaccessible. And we have a solution that gets us to the keys and resolves both the time and distance constraints. We must have a pattern now! Right?</p><div class="orm-notedivider"><hr data-AmznRemoved-M8="true"/></div><div class="note"><h3 class="title"><a id="ch13note05"></a>Brain Power</h3><p>We followed the Design Pattern definition and defined a problem, a context, and a solution (which works!).

Why? For starters, we know that a pattern needs to apply to a recurring problem. While an absent-minded person might lock his keys in the car often, breaking the car window doesn’t qualify as a solution that can be applied over and over (or at least isn’t likely to if we balance the goal with another constraint: cost).</p><p>It also fails in a couple of other ways: first, it isn’t easy to take this description, hand it to someone and have him apply it to his own unique problem. Second, we’ve violated an important but simple aspect of a pattern: we haven’t even given it a name! Without a name, the pattern doesn’t become part of a vocabulary that can be shared with other developers.</p><p>Luckily, patterns are not described and documented as a simple problem, context and solution; we have much better ways of describing patterns and collecting them together into <span class="emphasis"><em>patterns catalogs</em></span>.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00776a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00776"></a><img src="../Images/image01278.jpeg" alt="image with no caption" hisrc="figs/web/587fig01.png.jpg"/></div></div><div class="orm-notedivider"><hr data-AmznRemoved-M8="true"/></div><div class="sidebar"><a id="there_are_no_dumb_questions-id00187"></a><h3 class="title">There Are No Dumb Questions</h3><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><div class="qandaset"><table style="border: 0; width: 100%; "><colgroup><col style="text-align: left; width: 1%; "></col><col></col></colgroup><tbody><tr class="question"><td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top; "><a id="ch13qa1qe1"></a><a id="ch13qa1q1"></a><div><strong>Q:</strong></div></td><td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top; "><div><span class="strong"><strong>Q: Am I going to see pattern descriptions that are stated as a problem, a context and a solution?</strong></span></div></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top; "><a id="ch13qa1q1a1"></a><div><strong>A:</strong></div></td><td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top; "><div><span class="strong"><strong>A:</strong></span> Pattern descriptions, which you’ll typically find in pattern catalogs, are usually a bit more revealing than that.

Well, we’re sure they have their own reasons, but if you remember the movie, the force “shapes and controls the Universe.” Likewise, the forces in the pattern definition shape and control the solution. Only when a solution balances both sides of the force (the light side: your goal, and the dark side: the constraints) do we have a useful pattern.</p><p>This “force” terminology can be quite confusing when you first see it in pattern discussions, but just remember that there are two sides of the force (goals and constraints) and that they need to be balanced or resolved to create a pattern solution.

The Gang of Four are the guys that put together the first patterns catalog.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Joe</strong></span>: What’s in the catalog?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Jim</strong></span>: There is a set of related patterns. For each pattern there is a description that follows a template and spells out a lot of details of the pattern. For instance, each pattern has a <span class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span>.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Frank</strong></span>: Wow, that’s earth-shattering — a name! Imagine that.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Jim</strong></span>: Hold on, Frank; actually, the name is really important. When we have a name for a pattern, it gives us a way to talk about the pattern; you know, that whole shared vocabulary thing.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Frank</strong></span>: Okay, okay. I was just kidding. Go on, what else is there?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Jim</strong></span>: Well, like I was saying, every pattern follows a template. For each pattern we have a name and a few sections that tell us more about the pattern. For instance, there is an Intent section that describes what the pattern is, kind of like a definition. Then there are Motivation and Applicability sections that describe when and where the pattern might be used.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Joe</strong></span>: What about the design itself?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Jim</strong></span>: There are several sections that describe the class design along with all the classes that make it up and what their roles are. There is also a section that describes how to implement the pattern and often sample code to show you how.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Frank</strong></span>: It sounds like they’ve thought of everything.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Jim</strong></span>: There’s more. There are also examples of where the pattern has been used in real systems, as well as what I think is one of the most useful sections: how the pattern relates to other patterns.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Frank</strong></span>: Oh, you mean they tell you things like how state and strategy differ?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Jim</strong></span>: Exactly!</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Joe</strong></span>: So Jim, how are you actually using the catalog? When you have a problem, do you go fishing in the catalog for a solution?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Jim</strong></span>: I try to get familiar with all the patterns and their relationships first. Then, when I need a pattern, I have some idea of what it is. I go back and look at the Motivation and Applicability sections to make sure I’ve got it right. There is also another really important section: Consequences. I review that to make sure there won’t be some unintended effect on my design.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Frank</strong></span>: That makes sense. So once you know the pattern is right, how do you approach working it into your design and implementing it?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Jim</strong></span>: That’s where the class diagram comes in. I first read over the Structure section to review the diagram and then over the Participants section to make sure I understand each class’s role. From there, I work it into my design, making any alterations I need to make it fit. Then I review the Implementation and Sample code sections to make sure I know about any good implementation techniques or gotchas I might encounter.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Joe</strong></span>: I can see how a catalog is really going to accelerate my use of patterns!</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Frank</strong></span>: Totally.

Most patterns that appear to be new, are, in fact, just variants of existing patterns. By studying patterns, you become better at recognizing them, and you learn to relate them to other patterns.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Take time to reflect, evaluate.</strong></span> Your experience — the problems you’ve encountered, and the solutions you’ve used — are where ideas for patterns are born. So take some time to reflect on your experiences and comb them for novel designs that recur. Remember that most designs are variations on existing patterns and not new patterns. And when you do find what looks like a new pattern, its applicability may be too narrow to qualify as a real pattern.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Get your ideas down on paper in a way others can understand.</strong></span> Locating new patterns isn’t of much use if others can’t make use of your find; you need to document your pattern candidates so that others can read, understand, and apply them to their own solution and then supply you with feedback. Luckily, you don’t need to invent your own method of documenting your patterns. As you’ve already seen with the GoF template, a lot of thought has already gone into how to describe patterns and their characteristics.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Have others try your patterns; then refine and refine some more.</strong></span> Don’t expect to get your pattern right the first time. Think of your pattern as a work in progress that will improve over time. Have other developers review your candidate pattern, try it out, and give you feedback. Incorporate that feedback into your description and try again. Your description will never be perfect, but at some point it should be solid enough that other developers can read and understand it.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Don’t forget the Rule of Three.</strong></span> Remember, unless your pattern has been successfully applied in three real-world solutions, it can’t qualify as a pattern. That’s another good reason to get your pattern into the hands of others so they can try it, give feedback, and allow you to converge on a working pattern.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00779a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00779"></a><img src="../Images/image01281.jpeg" alt="image with no caption" hisrc="figs/web/593fig01.png.jpg"/></div></div><div class="orm-notedivider"><hr data-AmznRemoved-M8="true"/></div><div class="sidebar"><a id="who_does_whatquestion_mark-id00189"></a><h3 class="title">Who Does What?</h3><p><a id="iddle1010" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1026" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1187" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1236" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1348" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1588" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1610" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1631" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1643" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1661" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1819" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle2032" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle2163" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle2341" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle2375" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle2414" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle2464" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle2525" class="indexterm"></a>Match each pattern with its description:</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00780a"></a><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00780"></a><img src="../Images/image01282.jpeg" alt="image with no caption" hisrc="figs/web/594fig01.png.jpg"/></div></div></div><div class="orm-notedivider"><hr data-AmznRemoved-M8="true"/></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="organizing_design_patterns">Organizing Design Patterns</h2></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1388" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1551" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle2295" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle2296" class="indexterm"></a>As the number of discovered Design Patterns grows, it makes sense to partition them into classifications so that we can organize them, narrow our searches to a subset of all Design Patterns, and make comparisons within a group of patterns.</p><p>In most catalogs, you’ll find patterns grouped into one of a few classification schemes.

Here’s the thinking behind the Gang of Four classification: structural patterns describe how classes and objects are composed to create new structures or new functionality. The Decorator Pattern allows you to compose objects by wrapping one object with another to provide new functionality. So the focus is on how you compose the objects dynamically to gain functionality, rather than on the communication and interconnection between objects, which is the purpose of behavioral patterns. But remember, the intent of these patterns is different, and that’s often the key to understanding which category a pattern belongs to.</div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></blockquote></div></div><div class="orm-notedivider"><hr data-AmznRemoved-M8="true"/></div><div class="orm-notedivider"><hr data-AmznRemoved-M8="true"/></div><div class="sidebar"><a id="master_and_studenthellip-id00192"></a><h3 class="title">Master and Student...</h3><p><a id="iddle1071" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1336" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1375" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1379" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle1393" class="indexterm"></a><a id="iddle2425" class="indexterm"></a><span class="bolditalic">Master:</span> <span class="emphasis"><em>Grasshopper, you look troubled.</em></span></p><p><span class="bolditalic">Student:</span> <span class="emphasis"><em>Yes, I’ve just learned about pattern classification and I’m confused.</em></span></p><p><span class="bolditalic">Master:</span> <span class="emphasis"><em>Grasshopper, continue...</em></span></p><p><span class="bolditalic">Student:</span> <span class="emphasis"><em>After learning much about patterns, I’ve just been told that each pattern fits into one of three classifications: structural, behavioral, or creational.

Your goal should be simplicity, not “how can I apply a pattern to this problem?” Don’t feel like you aren’t a sophisticated developer if you don’t use a pattern to solve a problem. Other developers will appreciate and admire the simplicity of your design. That said, sometimes the best way to keep your design simple and flexible is to use a pattern.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="design_patterns_arenapostrophet_a_magic">Design Patterns aren’t a magic bullet; in fact, they’re not even a bullet!</h3></div></div></div><p>Patterns, as you know, are general solutions to recurring problems. Patterns also have the benefit of being well tested by lots of developers. So, when you see a need for one, you can sleep well knowing many developers have been there before and solved the problem using similar techniques.</p><p>However, patterns aren’t a magic bullet. You can’t plug one in, compile and then take an early lunch. To use patterns, you also need to think through the consequences for the rest of your design.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="you_know_you_need_a_pattern_whenhellip">You know you need a pattern when...</h3></div></div></div><p>Ah... the most important question: when do you use a pattern? As you approach your design, introduce a pattern when you’re sure it addresses a problem in your design. If a simpler solution might work, give that consideration before you commit to using a pattern.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Knowing</em></span> when a pattern applies is where your experience and knowledge come in. Once you’re sure a simple solution will not meet your needs, you should consider the problem along with the set of constraints under which the solution will need to operate — these will help you match your problem to a pattern. If you’ve got a good knowledge of patterns, you may know of a pattern that is a good match. Otherwise, survey patterns that look like they might solve the problem. The intent and applicability sections of the patterns catalogs are particularly useful for this. Once you’ve found a pattern that appears to be a good match, make sure it has a set of consequences you can live with and study its effect on the rest of your design. If everything looks good, go for it!</p><p><a id="iddle2210" class="indexterm"></a>There is one situation in which you’ll want to use a pattern even if a simpler solution would work: when you expect aspects of your system to vary. As we’ve seen, identifying areas of change in your design is usually a good sign that a pattern is needed. Just make sure you are adding patterns to deal with <span class="emphasis"><em>practical change</em></span> that is likely to happen, not <span class="emphasis"><em>hypothetical change</em></span> that may happen.</p><p>Design time isn’t the only time you want to consider introducing patterns; you’ll also want to do so at refactoring time.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="refactoring_time_is_patterns_timeexclama">Refactoring time is Patterns time!</h3></div></div></div><p>Refactoring is the process of making changes to your code to improve the way it is organized. The goal is to improve its structure, not change its behavior. This is a great time to reexamine your design to see if it might be better structured with patterns. For instance, code that is full of conditional statements might signal the need for the State Pattern. Or, it may be time to clean up concrete dependencies with a Factory. Entire books have been written on the topic of refactoring with patterns, and as your skills grow, you’ll want to study this area more.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="take_out_what_you_donapostrophet_really">Take out what you don’t really need.
